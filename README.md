🛡️ GuardianEye

Secure Mobile Video Recording & Emergency Surveillance System

GuardianEye is a secure mobile video recording application designed to provide a cost-effective, portable, and reliable surveillance solution using modern smartphones. Inspired by body-worn cameras, GuardianEye ensures data integrity, encryption, controlled access, and emergency response, making it suitable for personal safety, law enforcement support, and private documentation.

📌 Project Overview

GuardianEye leverages the power of smartphone cameras combined with strong security mechanisms to offer tamper-proof video recording and secure storage. The application focuses on privacy, authenticity, and controlled access to sensitive video evidence.

The system is developed using Flutter, ensuring cross-platform compatibility for Android and iOS devices.

🧱 System Architecture

GuardianEye follows a layered architecture:

📱 Presentation Layer (UI)

User registration & authentication

Video recording interface

SOS emergency controls

Settings and access permissions

⚙️ Business Logic Layer

Access control & permissions

Tamper-proof verification

Digital signatures & checksums

Emergency alert handling

🗄️ Data Layer

Encrypted local storage

Secure cloud backup

Access-controlled video retrieval

Secure deletion and data lifecycle management

🛠️ Technology Stack

Framework: Flutter

Languages: Dart

Architecture: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Process Model: Agile Methodology

Security: AES-based encryption with custom transformations

Platforms: Android & iOS

🔐 Encryption Approach

GuardianEye implements AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a custom Rubik’s Cube-inspired transformation layer to enhance security. This approach introduces additional diffusion and randomness through:

Row and column rotations

Diagonal swaps

Custom state matrix transformations

This makes encrypted video data significantly harder to analyze or tamper with.

📊 Data Management

The system securely manages:

User profiles (encrypted)

Video metadata & files

SOS emergency records

Cloud backups

User feedback

All sensitive data is protected using encryption and access control mechanisms.
